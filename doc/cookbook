This Cookbook provide an example of how to run CBDA and visualize the results.

1. Generate Synthetic Data:
  
  the firs step is to generate some synthetic data

2. Use CBDA.py with the synthetic data to obtain the density.

  Once you have your data, you have to edit the file pCBDA:
  
  # In data_input you can specify the path of your data
  
  data_input = ../input/quest.rrab.cmj_akv.dat
  
  # In data_output you can specify the output of the results comming form CBDA, see the documentation 
    to see how the ouput file of CBDA is printed.

  data_output =  ../output/1D_Obs_Quest_AR.dat

  # D specifies the dimension of 

  D = 1

  # Res = is the resolution of the 

  Res = 200

  # Number of neighbours to take into account, to calculate the density.

  K = 12

  # X data row of your input data
  
  N_X = 0

  # Y data row of your output data
  
  N_Y = 4
	
  # Define your data limits

  xmin_limit = 45

  xmax_limit = 160

  ymin_limit = 0

  ymax_limit = 35

  zmin_limit = 10

  zmax_limit = 70

this file would print a file with the following structure:
 X, Y, Z, Density (n_o), Sigma

3. Plot your results.

to run plots.py you need to edit the file pPLOTS:

# Specify if you want to make a histogra, 0 =  No, 1 = yes

	Histogram = 0

# Specify if you want to make the difference of two histograms (Residuals), 0 = No, 1 = Yes
	
	Residuals = 0

# Define wthe path of your density results obtained with CBDA.py

	densities_path_1 = ../output/1D_Obs_Quest_AR.dat

# If you want to make a residuals plot, you need to define the path to the second data file. residuals plots make (densities_path_1 - densities_path_2) 

	densities_path_2 = ../output/Obs_Quest_ARvsRhel.dat

# define the data corresponding to the density data files, this is used to make a scatter over plot in the density map.

	data_path_1 = ../input/mydata1.dat

	data_path_2 = ../input/mydata2.dat

# Define the ouput path of your histogram plot.

	out_histofig_path = ../output/plots/Quest_Obs.png

# Define the ouput path of your residuals histogram plot.

	out_residuesfig_path = ../output/plots/Quest_residuals.png

# Define the ouput path of your scatter plot.

	out_scatter = ../output/plots/Obs_Quest1D_AR.png
