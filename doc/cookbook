This Cookbook provide an example of how to run CBDA and visualize the results.

1. Generate Synthetic Data:
  
  the firs step is to generate some synthetic data

2. Use CBDA.py with the synthetic data to obtain the density.

  Once you have your data, you have to edit the file pCBDA:
  
  # In data_input you can specify the path of your data
  
  data_input = ../input/quest.rrab.cmj_akv.dat
  
  # In data_output you can specify the output of the results comming form CBDA, see the documentation 
    to see how the ouput file of CBDA is printed.

  data_output =  ../output/1D_Obs_Quest_AR.dat

  # D specifies the dimension of 

  D = 1

  # Res = is the resolution of the 

  Res = 200

  # Number of neighbours to take into account, to calculate the density.

  K = 12

  # X data row of your input data
  
  N_X = 0

  # Y data row of your output data
  
  N_Y = 4

  xmin_limit = 45

  xmax_limit = 160

  ymin_limit = 0

  ymax_limit = 35

  zmin_limit = 10

  zmax_limit = 70


3. Plot your results.
